/*:
**Exercise:** You have a secret message to send. Write a playground that can encrypt strings with an alphabetical [caesar cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher). This cipher can ignore numbers, symbols, and whitespace. Add a shift variable to indicate how many places to shift.
>> **Example Output:**
* Decrypted: Nearly all men can stand adversity, but if you want to test a man's character, give him power
* Encrypted: arneyl nyy zra pna fgnaq nqirefvgl, ohg vs lbh jnag gb grfg n zna'f punenpgre, tvir uvz cbjre
>> **Constraints:**
* Use a `switch` statment
* Use a loop statement
